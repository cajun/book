h2. Welcome to the Cajun Book

I created this cookbook to refine the art of cooking.  Here you will be able to 
start with a basic recipe and then refine that recipe so that it can be improved.
While making a recipe better you will be able to see all the different variations 
of that recipe that you have done. Here are some of the features:

* Rank ANYTHING
* Add Results to ANYTHING
* Have different brands per recipe
* See the cost of each recipe - almost done
* Print recipe cards - almost done
* Auto discover recipes - almost done

More to come soon....

it's cool
